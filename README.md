# Buzz Movie Selector
Partial iOS implementation of Buzz Movie Selector, a movie search and rating app for Georgia Techâ€™s CS 2340 class (Objects and Design).

#HTTP Requests
HTTP requests are handled using the [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) library.

#JSON Parsing
To parse the information obtained from the requests, I used the [SwiftyJSON](https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON) library.

#Movie Information
All the results shown in this app are obtained using the [Rotten Tomatoes](https://developer.rottentomatoes.com/) movie search API.
